Next Steps:

- Uploading picture functionality. 
- Make the clothes go to the DB.
- Refactor to use tokens instead of userID in the localStorage. 
- In marketplace, show who the seller of each item is. This is a bit complex. The username of the seller will have to be on the token when they are adding clothes and will go into the clothesOnSale db with each item that goes in. then marketplace will return each clothing item with the seller's username. You can click and go to the seller's profile page to see info about them, previous things they've sole and more. 
- Refactor Nav using NavLinks not history objects.
